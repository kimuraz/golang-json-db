# Golang JSON DB: Because who needs fancypants SQL databases anyway? ðŸ˜‚

This glorious bored-in-the-weekend-project, meticulously crafted in Go (although still learning it), throws away all conventional database wisdom and builds a brand new one... entirely out of JSON, rage, tears and duct tape (okay, maybe not duct tape).

## Why JSON and Binary Files?

- Flexibility: JSON lets us store pretty much anything, from your grandma's secret cookie recipe to your cat's sleeping positions (both equally valuable data, of course).
- Speed: Binary files are like ninjas of data storage - fast, silent, and efficient. Perfect for when you need to retrieve your cat memes in a flash.

## But Wait, There's More! ðŸ¤¯

This bad boy also boasts:

- Indexing: Find your data faster than a hummingbird searching for sugar water (almost).
- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete - all the verbs your data will ever need.

> So, is this the future of databases? Probably not. But hey, it's a fun ride!

## Getting Started (Because we know you're itching to try it out)

Clone this repo.
Grab a Go (1.22+) compiler (you know the drill).
Look around the code and run what you like!
Not ready yet, so just play around.
